This is my dissertation in raw .tex form.  

The readable dissertation is the file thesis-ku.pdf.  

It was written using MiKTeX with WinEdt 8.  All pictures were created usng Ipe.

The Python program was written in Python 2.7.2.  

Things to work on on the future:
	1. Convert it to Python 3.x.  
	2. Rework the comments because
		a. They are inline with the code, and
		b. They could use a little sprucing up anyway.  
	3. Get rid of the user input, and just have it read from a file.

These changes won't take place in this project, since this is meant to be storage place for my dissertation as published.  I will instead start another project where I can do these updates.
